A beginner’s guide to Chinese flute.

This guide assumes the reader is a beginner to dizi, however, it'll be helpful if you:
- have basic music theory
- played at least one instrument to some degree before
- know some Chinese (all Chinese terms will be translated, although it's not official)
- are willing to learn or already know how to read jianpu (numbered musical notation)

You should have or planning to buy:
- a flute
- dimo
- a dimo protector (recommended)
- a dizi bag or case(recommended)
- a flute cleaner or a very thin stick roughly 30-40cm long(recommended)
- a thin microfibre cloth to clean the flute (recommended)

## Introduction to Dizi

(Feel free to skip this section, it's just trivia)

Dizi, also known as Chinese flute, or Chinese bamboo flute, is a Chinese transverse flute. Although it's commonly known as Chinese bamboo flute, it can be made of different materials, such as wood or jade. 


Dizi is split into mainly two types:
- 曲笛 qudi, originated from the south of China, includes flute in the key of C, D, E
- 梆笛 bangdi, originated from the north of China, includes flute in the key of F, G, A
(In the above, C = middle C on the piano, and gradually goes up, there are also flat flutes, such as Eb or Bb)
Other than these two types, flute also comes in lower keys. But remember, the rest of the guide disregards these, so when we talk about C, D, E, F, G, A key flutes, I mean the above types:
- 大笛 dadi (lit: big flute, for lower tones such as low G, F, A, Bb)
- 倍低音笛 beidiyindi (lit: double bass flute, for even lower tones of C, D, E)

## Choosing Dizi

Main types of dizi ([source](http://mini.eastday.com/a/180601130248555.html?qid=02263&vqid=qid02650))

Note: the key of the flute does not matter as much as you think when it comes to practicing! So if you really can't decide, here's a tl:dr:
- For kids, choose F
- For adult learners, look at music pieces you want to play, see what key they're in, and choose that key (if that piece is in G, I suggest D flute)

The longer version:
For children or those who have smaller hands, choose F or G key. It's often regarded as the beginner's flute due to size (air flows easier). I personally recommend F, as a lot of traditional Chinese music is in the key of F.
For adults, it's recommended to pick up a C or D flute. It's bigger and therefore slightly harder to make a sound out of, but it helps with breathing practices, and makes it easier when you transition into smaller flutes for different pieces. You can't go wrong with either. 
Dizi can come in one whole dizi or be split via a connector. I suggest if possible get a 2-part dizi, for tuning (if needed) and it's easier to clean. 

Things to note when buying a dizi:
The head of the flute should be blocked, but when looking at the flute head on, you should not be able to see the blocked bit from the mouthpiece. 
The key of the flute is normally etched onto the flute.
There are often random poems etched into the head of the flute for esthetics

### Materials of Dizi

The most common material for Chinese flute is bamboo. Generally speaking, in terms of materials, they rank like this from good to best:
苦竹 bitter bamboo --> 紫竹 purple bamboo --> 湘妃竹 xiangfei bamboo
But in all honesty, a bitter bamboo flute can be made at a professional grade too, so don't be too hang up on the material of the flute! If possible, choose bamboo that has been aged for at least 3 years, the flute should be round, and it's normal for the head of the flute (mouthpiece side) to be slightly thicker than the tailend, but not by much. The most important thing is to check how accurate the sound of the flute is! 

Next common one is wooden flutes. Wooden flutes don't sound as crisp and clear as the bamboo flutes, but if you plan to play flute for the long term, I definitely recommend one. Bamboo flutes, if not looked after properly, can crack in the winter if it gets too cold. Wooden flutes are less likely to crack is it'll be a worthy investiment if you live in a colder area of the world. But with good care, a bamboo flute should last you through winter too.

### Dizi Care
After playing, clean your flute and store your flute horizontally in a case with the holes facing up, or in a bag vertically.
Keep away from sunshine, damp, and if possible don't take it outside.

You can clean the flute similar to a recorder or a concert flute - wrap a thin microfibre cloth around the dizi cleaner and clean the inside. Do note a F or G flute is very thin, and you may need to look for a thin flute cleaning stick. A normal concert flute cleaner will not be able to reach the whole length of a one-section C or D flute, so it might be good to look into DIY options if you have a one-section flute. A normal concert flute cleaner may not be able to fit in a smaller dizi either, so that's another point to consider.

## Dizi Basics

To play the flute, hold the dizi horizontally. You can hold it either way (left or right handed), whichever way is comfortable. Normal convention is to point it to the right side. There's no specific way to place your fingers on the holes, it's just whatever feels comfortable. 

If you have your flute, at this point you might be wondering what the holes are. From the top: mouthpiece, dimo (membrane hole), 6 fingering holes, and the last 2 holes are for decoration!
