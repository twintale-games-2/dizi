		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Dizi, also known as Chinese flute, or Chinese bamboo flute, is a Chinese transverse flute. Although it's
			commonly known as Chinese bamboo flute, it can be made of different materials, such as wood or jade.</p>
		<p>
			Dizi is split into mainly two types:
			<ul>
				<li>
					曲笛 qudi, originated from the south of China, includes flute in the key of C, D, E
				</li>
				<li>
					梆笛 bangdi, originated from the north of China, includes flute in the key of F, G, A (In the above, C
					= middle C on the piano, and gradually goes up, there are also flat flutes, such as Eb or Bb)
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than these two types, flute also comes in lower keys (below middle C on piano,or C4). But remember,
			the rest of the guide disregards these, so when we talk about C, D, E, F, G, A key flutes, I mean the above
			types:
			<ul>
				<li>
					大笛 dadi (lit: big flute, for lower tones such as low G, F, A, Bb)
				</li>
				<li>
					倍低音笛 beidiyindi (lit: double bass flute, for even lower tones of C, D, E)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For anyone interested in what a double bass flute looks like:

		<h2>Choosing dizi</h2>
		<h3>Which key to buy</h3>
		<img src="./resources/images/types_of_dizi.jpeg">
		<a href="http://mini.eastday.com/a/180601130248555.html?qid=02263&vqid=qid02650">Source</a>

		<p>
			Note: the key of the flute does not matter that much when it comes to practicing!
		</p>
		<p>
			If you really can't decide, here's a tl:dr:
			<ul>
				<li>For kids, choose F</li>
				<li>For adult learners, look at music pieces you want to play, see what key they're in, and choose that
					key (if that piece is in G, I suggest D flute)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The longer version:
		</p>
		<p>
			For children or those who have smaller hands, choose F or G key. It's often regarded as the beginner's flute
			due to size (air flows easier). I personally recommend F, as a lot of traditional Chinese music is in the
			key of F.
		</p>
		<p>
			For adults, it's recommended to pick up a C or D flute. It's bigger and therefore slightly harder to make a
			sound out of, but it helps with breathing practices, and makes it easier when you transition into smaller
			flutes for different pieces. You can't go wrong with either.Dizi can come in one whole dizi or be split via
			a connector. I suggest if possible get a 2-part dizi, for tuning (if needed) and it's easier to clean.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other things to consider when buying a dizi:
			<ul>
				<li>The head of the flute shoud be blocked, and when looking into the dizi directly from the mouthpiece
					the blocked section should not be seen</li>
				<li>The key of the dizi is normally etched onto the body</li>
				<li>The head of the dizi can be slightly bigger than the tail</li>
				<li>There are often random poems etched into the head of the dizi for esthetics</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Materials</h3>
		<p>
			The most common material for dizi is bamboo. Generally speaking, in terms of materials, they rank like this
			from good to best:
			<ul>
				<li>苦竹 bitter bamboo</li>
				<li>紫竹 purple bamboo</li>
				<li>湘妃竹 xiangfei bamboo</li>
			</ul>
			But in all honesty, a bitter bamboo dizi can be made at a professional grade too, so don't be too hang up on
			the material of the flute! If possible, choose bamboo that has been aged for at least 3 years, the flute
			should be round, and it's normal for the head of the flute (mouthpiece side) to be slightly thicker than the
			tailend, but not by much.
			<b>The most important thing is to check how accurate the sound of the flute is!</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Next common material is wood. Wooden dizi don't sound as crisp and clear as the bamboo dizi, but if you plan
			to play flute for the long term, I definitely recommend one. Bamboo dizi, if not looked after properly, can
			crack in the winter if it gets too cold. Wooden dizi are less likely to crack so it'll be a worthy
			investiment if you live in a colder area of the world. But with good care, a bamboo dizi should last you
			through winter too.
		</p>
		<h3>Dizi care</h3>
		<p>
			After playing, clean your dizi and store it horizontally in a case with the holes facing up, or in a bag
			vertically.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dizi should be kept away from sunshine and damp, and if possible don't take it outside.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can clean the dizi similar to a recorder or a concert flute - wrap a thin microfibre cloth around the
			dizi or flute cleaner and clean the inside. Do note a F or G flute is very thin, and you may need to look
			for a very thin flute cleaning stick. A normal concert flute cleaner will not be able to reach the whole
			length of a one-section C or D flute, so it might be good to look into DIY options if you have a one-section
			flute. A normal concert flute cleaner may not be able to fit in a smaller dizi either, so that's another
			point to consider.
		</p>

		<h2>Dizi basics</h2>
		<p>
			To play the flute, hold the dizi horizontally. You can hold it either way (left or right handed), whichever
			way is comfortable. Normal convention is to point it to the right side. There's no specific way to place
			your fingers on the holes, it's just whatever feels comfortable.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have your dizi, at this point you might be wondering what the holes are. From the top: mouthpiece,
			dimo (membrane hole), 6 fingerholes, and the last 2 holes are for decoration!
		</p>
		<h3>Dimo</h3>
		<p>
			Dimo is crucial to a good sounding dizi! A lot of beginners put off applying dimo but it's something that
			you should learn asap. Once you have a decent flute, the quality of dimo actually matters more to the sound
			quality of your flute than the bamboo type. Even if you have a professional class dizi, but your dimo is of
			poor quality, you won't be able to produce a clear and crisp sound that dizi should be capable of.
		</p>
		<p> Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/DtIIpkOk50Y">YouTube tutorial</a> on how to put on dimo for your dizi.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are the written steps:
			<ol>
				<li>Cut open a Dimo (they come in tubes) and cut out a piece that is big enough to cover the dimo hole
				</li>
				<li>Wet the outside of the dimo hole and rub some erjiao on the outside of the dimo hole</li>
				<li>Take the piece of dimo and prepare to stick on the dimo hole. Make sure the lines on the dimo is
					parallel to the length of the Dizi. After you stick the dimo onto the dimo, adjust the Dimo in such
					a way that you form creases or wrinkles perpendicular to the length of the dizi</li>
				<li>Wait for it to dry (at least 5 mins) before playing!</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don't have access to dimo or erjiao, you can use cling film, cut out a long piece and wrap it around
			the dimo hole, you may need to wrap it around 2-3 times to get the desired sound. This is just a temporary
			solution, please don't use this method permanently.</p>
		<p>
			Also if your dizi sounded normal for a while, then started to sound raspy, this could be caused by the
			change in temperature. Try to warm up your hands and place your palm over the dimo for a while.</p>
		<h3>Dizi tones</h3>

			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>C major</th>

		</p>
		<p>
			As you can see, although the actual note for 1, 2, 3... etc changes, the tonal relation between them don't
			change. There's always one whole tone between 1 and 2, and there's always half a tone between 3 and 4. Like
			a major key, jianpu goes up in tone-tone-semitone-tone-tone-tone-semitone patterns.
		</p>
		<h3>Dizi fingering and jianpu notation</h3>
		<p>
			High notes are denoted with a dot above the number, and low notes are denoted with a dot below the number. 2
			dots above means 2 octaves above, and 2 dots below means 2 octaves below.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jianpu notation for 1=C:
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>note: </th>
						<th>C</th>
						<th>D</th>
						<th>E</th>
						<th>F</th>
						<th>G</th>
						<th>A</th>
						<th>B</th>
						<th>C</th>
					</tr>

				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Jianpu: </td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>6</td>
						<td>7</td>
						<td>high 1</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</p>
		<p>
			Jianpu for 1=G:
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>note: </th>
						<th>C</th>
						<th>D</th>
						<th>E</th>
						<th>F</th>
						<th>G</th>
						<th>A</th>
						<th>B</th>
						<th>C</th>
					</tr>

				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Jianpu: </td>
						<td>low 4</td>
						<td>low 5</td>
						<td>low 6</td>
						<td>low 7</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>4</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</p>
		<p>
			As seen from above, 1 in jianpu doesn't always have the same note, this is also why flute comes in tones.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fingering charts are normally shown at the beginning of a piece of music, in the following forms:
			<ul>
				<li>
					1=x (example: 1=G, 1=C, 1=D etc.)
				</li>
				Makes the jianpu notation 1 = that note. What this means in practice is if the piece of music says 1=G,
				and the lowest note in that piece is low 5, then use a G flute. If the lowest note is between low 2 and
				low 5, then use a D flute with the conversion chart. This is the more common way to show what key the
				piece is in, but this make the performer decide what flute to use.
				<li>
					全按作低音 x or 筒音作 x (where x is a number)</li>
				I'll translate this as <b>base tone = x</b>. This means the note you play with all 6 fingerholes covered
				is x. This note is called 筒音 tongyin [base tone]. Example: 筒音作 5 means all holes covered plays a low 5.
				This instruction often comes in the form of [Key]调筒音作 x, such as D 调筒音作 2, meaning use a D flute, and
				all 6 fingerholes covered makes the note low 2 in this piece. This method gives the composer more
				control, and the performer doesn't have to convert the tones themselves.
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			As seen from above, depending on what key the piece is in, or what intructions are given, the fingerings for
			the flute is going to be different. For more info on jianpu: <a
