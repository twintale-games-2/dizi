	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Dizi, also known as Chinese flute, or Chinese bamboo flute, is a Chinese transverse flute. Although it's commonly known as Chinese bamboo flute, it can be made of different materials, such as wood or jade.</p>
<p>
Dizi is split into mainly two types:
<ul>
<li>
曲笛 qudi, originated from the south of China, includes flute in the key of C, D, E
</li><li>
梆笛 bangdi, originated from the north of China, includes flute in the key of F, G, A (In the above, C = middle C on the piano, and gradually goes up, there are also flat flutes, such as Eb or Bb) 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Other than these two types, flute also comes in lower keys (below middle C on piano,or C4). But remember, the rest of the guide disregards these, so when we talk about C, D, E, F, G, A key flutes, I mean the above types:
<ul>
<li>
大笛 dadi (lit: big flute, for lower tones such as low G, F, A, Bb)
</li><li>
倍低音笛 beidiyindi (lit: double bass flute, for even lower tones of C, D, E) 
</li></ul>
<p>For anyone interested in what a double bass flute looks like:
